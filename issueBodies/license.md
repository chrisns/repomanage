Missing a License

Without a license a user cannot use a project as they might be sued!

We officially default to [MIT](https://mit-license.org/), if you feel MIT isn't suitable for your project please raise it at a tech-lead meeting.

You can easily do this with the web GitHub interface:

1. **[Single click licence add](../community/license/new?template=MIT)**
1. Enter the organisation's full name
1. Click **Review and submit**
1. Click **Commit new file**
1. Click **Create pull request**
